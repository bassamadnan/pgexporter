/**
 * Extension Query Alternatives, or ext_query_alts, are alternatives of the same
 * extension query with different minimum requirements of extension version for
 * them to work.
 *
 * eg. An ext_query_alt may ask both column A and B from a server with extension
 * version X, just A if extension has version Y (given column B is not supported
 * by version Y).
 *
 * This allows sending that query to the server that has the highest extension
 * version support.
 *
 * To support insert as well as fetch (finding lower bound) of query to send
 * to server, ext_query_alts is an AVL tree by design using semantic versioning.

 * Query Alternatives, or query_alts, are alternatives of the same query with
 * different minimum requirements of PostgreSQL version for them to work.
 *
 * eg. A query_alt may ask both column A and B from a server with version X,
 * just A if server has version Y (given column B is not supporter
 * by version Y).
 *
 * This allows sending that query to the server that has the highest support.
 *
 * To support fast insert as well as fetch (finding lower bound) of query to
